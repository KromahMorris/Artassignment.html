    <h1> Travelling in Depression </h1>
    <p>
         when i was very little, i caught the travel bug. It started after my grandparents first brought me to their home in 
        france and i have now been to twenty-nine different countries. Each has give me a unique learning experience.<br>
    <br>
    At five, I marveled at the Eiffel Tower in the City of Lights. When I was eight, I stood in the heartt of piazza San marco
    feeding honrdes of pigeons, then glided down Venetian waterways on sleek gondolas. At thirteen, i was the ancient,
    Megalithic structure fo stonehenge and walked along the great wall of china, amazed that the thousand-year-old
    stones were still in place.<br /> 
    <br />
    It was through exploring cultures around the world that I first became 
    interested in language. <br /> <br />
    <img src="Fine.jpg.jpeg" alt="Mohammed.html"  />
    It began with french, which taught me the importance of pronunciation. I 
    remember once asking a store owner in paris where Rue des Pyramides was.
 But when I Pronounced it PYR-a-mides instead of pyr-A-mides, with
  more accent on the A, she looked at me bewildered. <br /> <br />
 In the eighth grade, I became fascinated with spanixh and aware of its 
    similarities with English through cognates. Baseball in spanish, for examples, is
    beisbol, which looks different but sounds nearly the same. thsi was incredible 
    to me as it made speech and comprehension more fluid, and today i find 
    that cognates come to the rescue when I forget how to say something in 
    spanish. <br> <br>Then, in high school, I developed an enthusiasm for chinese. As I studied 
        Chinese at my school, I marveled how if jst one stroke was missing from a 
        character, the meaning is lost. I loved how long words were formed by 
        combining simpler characters, so HUO meaning fire and shan meaning 
        mountain  can be joined to create Houshan which means volcano. I Love 
spending hours at a time practicing the caracters and I can feel the beauty and rhythm as I form them.
